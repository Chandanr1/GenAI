            "Summary: Saiyaara (lit. 'Wanderer star'  or 'Wandering lover') is a 2025 Indian Hindi-language musical romantic drama film directed by Mohit Suri. Produced by Yash Raj Films, it is loosely based on the 2004 Korean film A Moment to Remember. It stars debutant Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda in the lead roles of a singer-songwriter duo who fall in love.  Originally planned as a spiritual sequel to Suri's Aashiqui 2 (2013), creative differences with producers Mukesh Bhatt and Bhushan Kumar led to the project being reworked into a standalone film under Yash Raj Films. \n",
            "Saiyaara was released theatrically on 18 July 2025 to positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Panday and Padda's performances, story, Suri's direction, and its soundtrack. A major commercial success, the film grossed over ₹5.79 billion (US$68 million) worldwide, emerging as the second highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025, and the highest-grossing Indian romantic film of all time. The film's soundtrack proved to be particularly popular, with its lead single \"Saiyaara\" topping several Indian and global music charts, remaining in the top ten for multiple weeks after its release.\n",
